# Prompt Optimizer

Analyze a draft prompt, critique it, match it to ECC ecosystem components,
and output a complete optimized prompt the user can paste and run.

## When to Use

- User says "optimize this prompt", "improve my prompt", "rewrite this prompt"
- User says "help me write a better prompt for..."
- User says "what's the best way to ask Claude Code to..."
- User pastes a draft prompt and asks for feedback or enhancement
- User says "I don't know how to prompt for this"
- User says "how should I use ECC for..."
- User explicitly invokes `/prompt-optimize`

### Do Not Use When

- User wants the task done directly (just execute it)
- User says "optimize this code", "optimize performance" — these are refactoring tasksks, not prompt optimization
- User is asking about ECC configuration (use `configure-ecc` instead)
- User wants a skill inventory (use `skill-stocktake` instead)
- User says "just do it"

## How It Works

**Advisory only — do not execute the user's task.**

Do NOT write code, create files, run commands, or take any implementation
action. Your ONLY output is an analysis plus an optimized prompt.

If the user says "just do it", or "don't optimize, just execute",
do not switch into implementation mode inside this skill. Tell the user this
skill only produces optimized prompts, and instruct them to make a normal
task request if they want execution instead.

Run this 6-phase pipeline sequentially. Present results using the Output Format below.

### Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 0: Project Detection

Before analyzing the prompt, detect the current project context:

1. Check if a `CLAUDE.md` exists in the working directory — read it for project conventions
2. Detect tech stack from project files:
   - `package.json` → Node.js / TypeScript / React / Next.js
   - `go.mod` → Go
   - `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` → Python
   - `Cargo.toml` → Rust
   - `build.gradle` / `pom.xml` → Java / Kotlin (then check for `quarkus` in build file → Quarkus, or `spring-boot` → Spring Boot)
   - `Package.swift` → Swift
   - `Gemfile` → Ruby
   - `composer.json` → PHP
   - `*.csproj` / `*.sln` → .NET
   - `Makefile` / `CMakeLists.txt` → C / C++
   - `cpanfile` / `Makefile.PL` → Perl
3. Note detected tech stack for use in Phase 3 and Phase 4

If no project files are found (e.g., the prompt is abstract or for a new project),
skip detection and flag "tech stack unknown" in Phase 4.

### Phase 1: Intent Detection

Classify the user's task into one or more categories:

| Category | Signal Words | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| New Feature | build, create, add, implement | "Build a login page" |
| Bug Fix | fix, broken, not working, error | "Fix the auth flow" |
| Refactor | refactor, clean up, restructure | "Refactor the API layer" |
| Research | how to, what is, explore, investigate | "How to add SSO" |
| Testing | test, coverage, verify | "Add tests for the cart" |
| Review | review, audit, check | "Review my PR" |
| Documentation | document, update docs | "Update the API docs" |
| Infrastructure | deploy, CI, docker, database | "Set up CI/CD pipeline" |
| Design | design, architecture, plan | "Design the data model" |

### Phase 2: Scope Assessment

If Phase 0 detected a project, use codebase size as a signal. Otherwise, estimate
from the prompt description alone and mark the estimate as uncertain.

| Scope | Heuristic | Orchestration |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| TRIVIAL | Single file, < 50 lines | Direct execution |
| LOW | Single component or module | Single command or skill |
| MEDIUM | Multiple components, same domain | Command chain + /verify |
| HIGH | Cross-domain, 5+ files | /plan first, then phased execution |
| EPIC | Multi-session, multi-PR, architectural shift | Use blueprint skill for multi-session plan |

### Phase 3: ECC Component Matching

Map intent + scope + tech stack (from Phase 0) to specific ECC components.

#### By Intent Type

| Intent | Commands | Skills | Agents |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| New Feature | /plan, /tdd, /code-review, /verify | tdd-workflow, verification-loop | planner, tdd-guide, code-reviewer |
| Bug Fix | /tdd, /build-fix, /verify | tdd-workflow | tdd-guide, build-error-resolver |
| Refactor | /refactor-clean, /code-review, /verify | verification-loop | refactor-cleaner, code-reviewer |
| Research | /plan | search-first, iterative-retrieval | — |
| Testing | /tdd, /e2e, /test-coverage | tdd-workflow, e2e-testing | tdd-guide, e2e-runner |
| Review | /code-review | security-review | code-reviewer, security-reviewer |
| Documentation | /update-docs, /update-codemaps | — | doc-updater |
| Infrastructure | /plan, /verify | docker-patterns, deployment-patterns, database-migrations | architect |
| Design (MEDIUM-HIGH) | /plan | — | planner, architect |
| Design (EPIC) | — | blueprint (invoke as skill) | planner, architect |

#### By Tech Stack

| Tech Stack | Skills to Add | Agent |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Python / Django | django-patterns, django-tdd, django-security, django-verification, python-patterns, python-testing | python-reviewer |
| Go | golang-patterns, golang-testing | go-reviewer, go-build-resolver |
| Spring Boot / Java | springboot-patterns, springboot-tdd, springboot-security, springboot-verification, java-coding-standards, jpa-patterns | java-reviewer |
| Quarkus / Java | quarkus-patterns, quarkus-tdd, quarkus-security, quarkus-verification, java-coding-standards, jpa-patterns | java-reviewer |
| Kotlin / Android | kotlin-coroutines-flows, compose-multiplatform-patterns, android-clean-architecture | kotlin-reviewer |
| TypeScript / React | frontend-patterns, backend-patterns, coding-standards | code-reviewer |
| Swift / iOS | swiftui-patterns, swift-concurrency-6-2, swift-actor-persistence, swift-protocol-di-testing | code-reviewer |
| PostgreSQL | postgres-patterns, database-migrations | database-reviewer |
| Perl | perl-patterns, perl-testing, perl-security | code-reviewer |
| C++ | cpp-coding-standards, cpp-testing | code-reviewer |
| Other / Unlisted | coding-standards (universal) | code-reviewer |

### Phase 4: Missing Context Detection

Scan the prompt for missing critical information. Check each item and mark
whether Phase 0 auto-detected it or the user must supply it:

- [ ] **Tech stack** — Detected in Phase 0, or must user specify?
- [ ] **Target scope** — Files, directories, or modules mentioned?
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** — How to know the task is done?
- [ ] **Error handling** — Edge cases and failure modes addressed?
- [ ] **Security requirements** — Auth, input validation, secrets?
- [ ] **Testing expectations** — Unit, integration, E2E?
- [ ] **Performance constraints** — Load, latency, resource limits?
- [ ] **UI/UX requirements** — Design specs, responsive, a11y? (if frontend)
- [ ] **Database changes** — Schema, migrations, indexes? (if data layer)
- [ ] **Existing patterns** — Reference files or conventions to follow?
- [ ] **Scope boundaries** — What NOT to do?

**If 3+ critical items are missing**, ask the user up to 3 clarification
questions before generating the optimized prompt. Then incorporate the
answers into the optimized prompt.

### Phase 5: Workflow & Model Recommendation

Determine where this prompt sits in the development lifecycle:

```
Research → Plan → Implement (TDD) → Review → Verify → Commit
```

For MEDIUM+ tasks, always start with /plan. For EPIC tasks, use blueprint skill.

**Model recommendation** (include in output):

| Scope | Recommended Model | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| TRIVIAL-LOW | Sonnet 5 | Fast, cost-efficient for simple tasks |
| MEDIUM | Sonnet 5 | Best coding model for standard work |
| HIGH | Sonnet 5 (main) + Opus 5 (planning) | Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation |
| EPIC | Opus 5 (blueprint) + Sonnet 5 (execution) | Deep reasoning for multi-session planning |

**Multi-prompt splitting** (for HIGH/EPIC scope):

For tasks that exceed a single session, split into sequential prompts:
- Prompt 1: Research + Plan (use search-first skill, then /plan)
- Prompt 2-N: Implement one phase per prompt (each ends with /verify)
- Final Prompt: Integration test + /code-review across all phases
- Use /save-session and /resume-session to preserve context between sessions

## Output Format

Present your analysis in this exact structure. Respond in the same language
as the user's input.

### Section 1: Prompt Diagnosis

**Strengths:** List what the original prompt does well.

**Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Suggested Fix |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| (problem) | (consequence) | (how to fix) |

**Needs Clarification:** Numbered list of questions the user should answer.
If Phase 0 auto-detected the answer, state it instead of asking.

### Section 2: Recommended ECC Components

| Type | Component | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Command | /plan | Plan architecture before coding |
| Skill | tdd-workflow | TDD methodology guidance |
| Agent | code-reviewer | Post-implementation review |
| Model | Sonnet 5 | Recommended for this scope |

### Section 3: Optimized Prompt — Full Version

Present the complete optimized prompt inside a single fenced code block.
The prompt must be self-contained and ready to copy-paste. Include:
- Clear task description with context
- Tech stack (detected or specified)
- /command invocations at the right workflow stages
- Acceptance criteria
- Verification steps
- Scope boundaries (what NOT to do)

For items that reference blueprint, write: "Use the blueprint skill to..."
(not `/blueprint`, since blueprint is a skill, not a command).

### Section 4: Optimized Prompt — Quick Version

A compact version for experienced ECC users. Vary by intent type:

| Intent | Quick Pattern |
|--------|--------------|
| New Feature | `/plan [feature]. /tdd to implement. /code-review. /verify.` |
| Bug Fix | `/tdd — write failing test for [bug]. Fix to green. /verify.` |
| Refactor | `/refactor-clean [scope]. /code-review. /verify.` |
| Research | `Use search-first skill for [topic]. /plan based on findings.` |
| Testing | `/tdd [module]. /e2e for critical flows. /test-coverage.` |
| Review | `/code-review. Then use security-reviewer agent.` |
| Docs | `/update-docs. /update-codemaps.` |
| EPIC | `Use blueprint skill for "[objective]". Execute phases with /verify gates.` |

### Section 5: Enhancement Rationale

| Enhancement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| (what was added) | (why it matters) |

## Examples

### Trigger Examples

- "Optimize this prompt for ECC"
- "Rewrite this prompt so Claude Code uses the right commands"
- "How should I prompt ECC for this task?"

### Example 1: Vague Feature Request

**User input**: `Add user profile endpoint`  
**Detected context**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

**Optimized Prompt**:
```markdown
Add a REST API endpoint for user profile updates (`PATCH /api/users/:id`).
Tech stack: Express + TypeScript (detected from project).

Requirements:
- Partial update for name, email, avatar_url with Zod validation
- Enforce authentication; ensure users can only modify their own profile
- Return 200 on success, 400 on validation failure, 401/403 on unauthorized
- Write table-driven unit tests covering success and failure branches
- Adhere to existing router/controller patterns in the codebase
```

### Example 2: Architecture Migration (EPIC Scope)

**User input**: `Migrate our monolith to microservices`

**Optimized Prompt**:
```markdown
Plan phased modular decomposition using blueprint workflow:
1. Map domain boundaries and identify lowest-coupling service to extract first
2. Configure gateway, container specs, and contract testing harness
3. Extract first service via Strangler Fig pattern; verify with integration tests
4. Decommission monolith components sequentially across separate gated PRs
```
